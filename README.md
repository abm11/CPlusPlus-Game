# CPlusPlus-Game
This game was produced as part of my enrollment on my university's C++ module. It uses the SDL library to to run.
The initial work submitted was a technical exercise. I am currently developing the code into something more competent and exciting.

## Prerequisites
This program requires SDL2 alongside a C++ compiler (Visual Studio was used in the code's development).

The SDL library is available at
```
https://www.libsdl.org/
```
To run the program, build the CPlusPlus-Game.sln file before executing it.

## Controls
W,A,S,D - Directional control
Left shift - Speed boost
Space bar - Attack (currently limited to visual effect)
