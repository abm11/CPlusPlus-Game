# CplusPlus-Game


## Getting started
Windows:
========
If you are running on Visual Studio, run the CPlusPlus-Game.sln file which is in this directory.

When you build, the output executables will be placed in the Debug and Release directories in this folder.
When you run the program from within visual studio, it will look for things like the fonts and images in the src directory.
